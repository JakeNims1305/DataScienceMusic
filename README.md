Goal: To generate original classical piano music based off of Beethoven and Mozart piano concertos. Previous projects have successfuly captured the "sound" of those composers, but weren't able to get the repeated melodic structures to really be able to call it organized music. Our specific goal was to add Attention layers to help create that ability, as that is something we haven't really seen much of/at all in our research. 

Explanation: Our code is built off of a previous group's work. To see what we did and what our results were, links to that group's work, and our research sources to help our group understand all of the relevant knowledge we needed to complete the project, please check our Medium/TowardsDataScience post here:
